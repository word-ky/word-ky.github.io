## About Me

I am **Jiaqi Wu (吴佳奇)**, currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the CIMS Institute, Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, working under the supervision of **[Associate Professor Gao Huang](https://gaohuang-net.github.io/)** (expert in Dynamic Neural Networks and author of the DenseNet).

I received my Master's degree from the School of Mechanical, Electronic and Information Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing) in 2019. In 2021, I transitioned to a direct Ph.D. program at the School of Artificial Intelligence under the supervision of **Professor Zijian Tian**. In 2024, I was awarded the China Scholarship Council (CSC) scholarship to conduct research as a visiting scholar at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia (UBC), where I joined **[Professor Victor C.M. Leung's](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~vleung/)** research group (Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering, IEEE Life Fellow) under the co-supervision of 
**[Professor Zehua Wang](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~zwang/)**.

I hold a Ph.D. degree in Information and Communication Engineering.

## Research Interests

My research interests primarily focus on the following areas:

### 1. Computer Vision In IoVT
- **Industrial Applications**: Integration of deep learning algorithms with edge computing for intelligent systems in UAV inspection and other industrial scenarios

### 2. Distributed Computing
- Distributed inference based on edge computing and cloud-edge-terminal collaborative computing
- Federated Learning

### 3. Multimodal Learning
- Multimodal Alignment

### 4. Large Models
- Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
- Hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM)
